# Microsoft 365 Analytics & Insights

These docs aim to give detailed information of the requirements, installation process and set up of the solution so that you can install it in a Microsoft 365 tenant.

1. First, head over to the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) to learn what's needed.
2. Then, read the [installation docs](install.md) to learn about the installation process.

There are several solutions built with the analytics engine:
- Adoptify
- SharePoint Insights
- [Activity and Usage Analytics](analytics/README.md)

Some of these solutions require additional configuration after the analytics engine has been installed. Please review the [post-install docs](install.md#additional-solutions).
